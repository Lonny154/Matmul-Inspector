# Tridiagonal solver baseline benchmark

The `tridiagonal-benchmark` executable compares the existing CPU Thomas, CPU PCR,
and naive CUDA PCR implementations. Its defaults cover system sizes
`32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096` and batch sizes `1,8,32,128,512`.

```sh
cmake --build build -j
./build/tridiagonal-benchmark \
  --warmups 3 --iterations 20 \
  --output results/tridiagonal-baseline
```

`summary.csv` has one row for each algorithm, backend, timing scope, system size,
and system count. The legacy-compatible `batch_size` column is that system count;
it does **not** mean simultaneous batched GPU execution. The `batch_execution`
column records `serial_host_loop` to make this explicit. The CSV also records
warmups, iterations, median, mean, minimum, and maximum
latency in milliseconds. These statistics use the same `benchmark::Sample` and
`benchmark::analyze` implementation as the matrix workflows. Each latency is for
the complete requested batch, not one system. `methodology.txt` travels with the
CSV as a compact timing-scope description.

Before timing, the harness creates deterministic diagonally dominant systems from
known solutions. Every benchmark path validates its final solutions. Sizes need
not be powers of two; size 33 is included in automated benchmark integration tests.

## Timing scopes

- CPU `end_to_end` uses `steady_clock` around the full batch. It includes solver
  working/output allocation and computation.
- CUDA `kernel_only` allocates buffers and uploads coefficients before sampling.
  Before every sample it restores the input coefficient buffers outside the CUDA
  event because PCR mutates them. The event spans all existing PCR stage and solve
  kernel launches for the batch. Allocation, H2D resets, D2H result copies,
  validation, and cleanup are excluded.
- CUDA `end_to_end` uses `steady_clock` around the existing `solve_pcr_cuda` call
  for every system in the batch. It includes host/device allocation, coefficient
  preparation, H2D copies, kernel execution and synchronization, D2H copies, and
  cleanup.

The CUDA multi-system path is intentionally a serial host loop over independent
invocations of the current naive PCR kernels. Both `kernel_only` and `end_to_end`
measure all systems in that loop as one sample. This is a serial multi-system
baseline, not a true batched GPU implementation. This milestone establishes a transparent baseline. It
does not add shared memory, warp shuffles, fusion, specialized batched kernels, or
any other PCR optimization. A future optimization experiment will implement true
batched PCR by exposing both the system index and the equation index as GPU
parallelism. That implementation should use a new named path so its results remain
directly comparable to this serial baseline.
